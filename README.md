# Fine-Tuning DeepSeek R1 for Medical Reasoning

##  Project Overview  
This project focuses on fine-tuning **DeepSeek R1**, an advanced open-weight LLM, for **medical reasoning and clinical decision-making**. We employ **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning**, LoRA, and QLoRA to optimize training efficiency while maintaining high performance.
